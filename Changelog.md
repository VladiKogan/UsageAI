## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Native Windows system-tray app for monitoring Codex usage.
- Five-hour and weekly quota meters, shown when reported by Codex.
- Reset countdowns and available full-reset credit count.
- Dynamic tray icon reflecting the most-used quota window.
- Automatic five-minute refresh and manual refresh controls.
- Optional launch at Windows sign-in.
- Diagnostic mode for validating the local Codex connection.
- Privacy-first access through the existing Codex CLI login, without stored API keys or browser cookies.

### Notes

- Codex app-server integration is experimental and isolated in the usage client for easier future updates.
